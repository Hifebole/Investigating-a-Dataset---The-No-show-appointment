Insights
My Submission for Project One of the data analyst nanodegree on udacity

The objective of this project is to draw insights from to data about patients that showed up or didn't show up for their appointments at the hospital, 
to see trends and patterns and draw some conclusions if need be

This project contains the dataset, a report of the analysis in pdf format and the jupyter notebook as well.

The dataset was gotten from kaggle the "No-show Appointment" dataset
